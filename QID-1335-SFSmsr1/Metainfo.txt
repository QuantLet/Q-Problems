Name of QuantLet: SFSmsr1

Published in: 'Statistics of Financial Markets : Exercises and Solutions'

Description: Shows the rate of convergence to infinity for the stable distributed random variables is higher than for standard normal variables. Plots the convergence rate of maximum for n random variables with a standard normal cdf and with a 1.1-stable cdf. Refers to exercise 16.2 in SFS.

Keywords: cdf, normal, random, stable

Output: 
- Plots of the convergence rate of maxima for standard normal cdf and 1.1-stable cdf.

Example: 'Convergence rate of maxima for standard normal cdf. Convergence rate of maximum for n random variables with a 1:1-stable cdf.'

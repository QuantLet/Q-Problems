Published in: Statistics of Financial Markets

Description: 'Two plots of stable distributions are generated. The upper plot shows the density function and the lower it's log. The parameters can be adjusted by a panel, where the four parameter (alpha=(0,2]; beta=[-1,1]; gamma>0; delta=[-2,2]) of an alpha-stable distribution can be modified. The user can choose between three parametrization (S1; S2; S3) and the exact stable distributions Normal, Cauchy and Levy.'
